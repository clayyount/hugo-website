I'll be at [SPX](http://www.spxpo.com/) Saturday and Sunday this weekend. If you're attending, please drop by and say hello! I'll be at table G8, right next to Ross Nover of [Super Art Fight](http://www.superartfight.com/) / [System Comic](http://www.systemcomic.com/), who was nice enought to sell me his extra space. Hamlet's Danish is still pretty new, so there isn't a lot of merchandise, but I did manage to print a small run of an issue collecting the first 24 strips.

I'll also be selling large prints of [Edwin Scuttle's Cat Map](http://clayyount.com/hamlets-danish-comic/2014/5/12/catography)

and finally, there will be prints of individual comic strips and some super discount double secret mystery merchandise. I hope to see some of you guys there!
