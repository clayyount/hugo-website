In the time between when Rob and Elliot ended and Hamlet's Danish began, I drew a couple short comic stories for an online competition. It was a way for me to keep in practice, and to try and grow as a storyteller. They were based on a random subject chosen for the competition, so they are one off ideas that I don't plan on continuing. 

I realized that a lot of people who visit this site haven't seen them since they are buried on my [artwork page](/artwork), so I thought I would take the time to post them here. Hope you enjoy them!
