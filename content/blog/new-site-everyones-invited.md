So you may have noticed the new site design. Usually a design update signifies nothing more than boredom on my part, but this time, there's a very good reason for the new look...

> “I’m releasing a Squarespace webcomic template!”

If you are like me and want to use [Squarespace](http://squarespace.com/) instead of Wordpress or Tumblr to host your comic, but can't find any resources for webcomic artists, today is your lucky day! For those of you who aren't aware, Squarespace is a rock-solid web hosting/gorgeous content management system that, until now, has not had a template option customized for webcomic artists. I've spent my free time in the past few months putting together a template tailored to the needs of webcomic artists, and I'm bundling it together with a tutorial to explain the nuts and bolts of getting started. It's possible to get a site up and running in my template without any coding, but it also allows for 100% code control over HTML/CSS/JS if you want it.

For an idea of what a site built on the template looks like, this site is your example. It's built 100% off the template I'm releasing today. It has a mobile responsive design and flexible layout that can accomodate a ton of variety. So if you're like me, and love Squarespace, but couldn't find a solution for webcomic artists, give it a try, and see if it's for you.

Oh, and by the way, this template is FREE. I built it because I would have really liked to have it when I first started building my site, and I want to give that to other people. If you feel the need to compensate me, just spread the word about Hamlet's Danish!
