I've gotten the question "Why did you name your comic Hamlet's Danish?" enough times that I figured I'd give a little explaination. The main problem with naming a comic that's about nothing in particular is that you can't choose a descriptive or thematic name. "Scenarios I Think Are Funny" isn't particularly catchy, and is bad SEO to boot. I figured if the name of the strip wasn't going to be descriptive, it might as well convey my sense of humor. So I went with a pun that didn't come up in any Google searches.

If you know one thing about my sense of humor, you know that I _love_ me some puns.

My first instinct when writing a script is to try and be as clever as I can with joke construction. That isn't necessarily a bad instinct to have, but it can affect a joke's accesibility if it's pushed too far. Accesibility is pretty important for a humor strip, and I need to constantly check myself before I wreck myself. Luckily, I have an assorment of trusted friends to help me know when I've gone too far. Even so, I can't help but indulge every once in a while, and I end up making a [strip about MacGuffins](http://clayyount.com/hamlets-danish-comic/2014/7/20/mctropes) which, if you don't know what a [MacGuffin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin) is, doesn't work _at all_.

But I'm ok with riding the line between accesible and niche. I want people to go back and find hidden jokes that they didn't catch the first time. I want people to wonder if they were even put there intentionally. This would be the theme of Hamlet's Danish if there was one. It's not video games or pop-culture references, it's my love and admiration for a border-line overthought joke. It may never have mass appeal, but my hope is that if a joke does hit you, it hits you _hard_. Hopefully it'll find an audience, and hopefully it's you.
